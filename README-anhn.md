## Experience
### NASA Ames Center, Machine Learning Engineering Intern June 2023 – August 2023 
- Constructed a retrieval-augmented generative Q&A pipeline with Haystack to help engineers in preliminary design review and risk assessment of different NASA missions, foundation for potential usage from 100+ engineers
- Integrated pipeline to internal full-stack app using ReactJS front-end with an ExpressJS & Gunicorn back-end

### Stanford University, CS 106 Teaching Assistant September 2023 – Present
- Taught weekly lecture-style workshops to 10+ students in Python and programming methodology as well as running interactive grading sessions and office hours for topics such as recursive backtracking, data structures, and C++, supporting Stanford's two largest CS courses with roughly 1200 student enrollment

### Stanford Machine Learning Group Bootcamp  (Andrew Ng’s Group) April 2023 – June 2023
- Performed fine-tuning and zero-shot evaluation on Alpaca LLM to annotate veterinarian medical text datasets with disease labels, a task previously done with fully supervised and unsupervised training of language models
- Built Python/Jupyter/bash scripts for prompt engineering 15+ few-shot, zero-shots, and chain-of thought schemes
Established both an evaluation pipeline and metric visualization for zero-shot disease classification        

### NASA Ames Center, Software Engineering Intern (Full-Stack) June 2021 – August 2021
- Constructed an internal timeline web application, to visualize mission progress for various NASA teams
- Implemented expandable event nodes with various different views, pulling events from internal RESTful APIs with an ExpressJS & MongoDB backend
