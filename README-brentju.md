# Hi! My name is Brent Ju.
Below is a brief introduction of myself.

## Technical Skills
My 3 strongest programming languages would probably be Python, Java, and C++ in that order. I'm familiar with a handful of app development frameworks, including but not limited to React, Vue.js, Next.js, Flask, and Google Firebase. Since I'm on the artificial intelligence track of the CS major, I'm also familiar with using cloud compute resources and libraries like PyTorch, HuggingFace, and TensorFlow. 

## Previous Projects
* **An LLM for parsing meaning from song lyrics.** I worked on this project as my final for CS224n where we finetuned an instance of a T5 model and built a named entity recognition model to create a pipeline that could generate annotations for the meanings behind song lyrics, similar to what contributors on Genius Lyrics do for songs.

* **Social Media App.** I'm currently working on (yet another) social media app with my old roommates that supports the ability to subscribe to your favorite creators and hold auctions to sell memorabilia and merchandise. The tech stack I'm using is primarily React Native and Firestore for ease of development and scaling.

## Fun facts about me
* I'm a big sports fan: I enjoy watching the Ohio State Buckeyes and I like playing golf in my free time.
 
* I got into playing poker about a year ago but truth be told I kind of suck at it

* I like cooking for myself and I really like getting to try new restaurants all around the Bay Area.
