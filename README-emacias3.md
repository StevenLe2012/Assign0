## Introduction
My name is Emily Macias and I am a junior studying computer science in the human-computer interaction
track. I am very interested in learning what goes into designing good UI/UX and how to use the
design process to create good solutions for problems!

Programming Languages That I Know:
- C++ (Proficient)
- C (Proficient)
- Python (Proficient)

## My Projects
The project that I am most proud of is my CS147 project (introduction to human-computer interaction)
where my team and I designed and built an app where musicians can upload music and performances
for feedback and can give feedback to other musicians. Our team went through the entire design
process which included conducting interviews, brainstorming needs, creating a low-fi prototype,
conducting user tests, creating a Figma med-fi prototype, and coding the app. I was able to gain 
a lot of experience with frontend development and introductory experience with backend. You can learn
