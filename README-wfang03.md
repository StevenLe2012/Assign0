## About Me

Hey everyone, I'm Will! I'm currently studying HCI and AI and am interested in building impactful AI-integrated software. I have experience with computer vision, full-stack development, UX research, and data science. I also love learning & working with new tech stacks!

## Recent Projects

- Designed (conducted needfinding interviews, created low- and med-fi prototypes, user tested, performed heuristic evaluations) and developed full-stack app with React Native, Supabase; facilitate musician collaboration and connection by creating a platform to give/receive feedback: (https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs147/projects/HarmoniousTies/keynotes/)
- CS231N: Used visual transformers (ViT) to achieve 99.9% accuracy on ASL alphabet dataset; used PyTorch. Also experimented with convolutional-based approaches.

## Technical Skills

Python (PyTorch, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy), SQL, React Native, Javascript/TypeScript; currently learning Flutter.
