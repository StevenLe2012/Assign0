## Previous projects

### Monster Hatchery
*CS193X class project*

Play the game here! https://cs193x-monster-hatchery.vercel.app/
- If you were a big fan of Neopets (like me) or are generally just a fan of monster nursery and raising simulators (think Digimon, Pokemon...) (also like me), I think you'll enjoy this simple little game
- Full stack JavaScript interactive web application that updates player progress in real time
- RESTful API developed with Node and Express to handle client requests and store player data in MongoDB
- Utilized Google Sign-In for player login; deployed via Vercel

### Research: Utilizing relatedness to improve classification accuracy on long-tailed data
*CS197 class project*
- Investigated possibility of improving ResNet-18 classification accuracy by leveraging phylogenetic relationships
- Worked closely with a PhD mentor and two undergrad team members
- Utilized Google CoLab Notebooks with PyTorch, Biopython, pandas, NumPy

## Fun facts :D
- I'm a digital artist and animator! I've participated in multiple online Multi Animator Projects (MAPs) and directed a short film. I'm working on a personal short film right now that touches on themes of love, trans identities, and autosexuality
- I love cooking!
- I love learning and talking about queerness, agriculture, food systems, and the philosophy and politics of kink.

Feel free to ask me about any of my interests <3 I'm an open book and am usually always down for discussion. :)
