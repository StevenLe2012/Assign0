**SGNL**
Synthetic Systems of Record Dataset Generation for testing graph database performance under projected workloads at scale
Authored Design Doc; developed optimized python scripts to generate dynamically-sized synthetic datasets supporting 1M+ entities/tenant and 3M+ relationships/tenant ingested from directories (Workday) and CRMs (Salesforce)

**Stanford Fung Lab**
Initiated project to automate candidate-job matching process of the “Neurodiversity at Work” clinical trial (Github)
Using Named Entity Resolution to accelerate and scale-up resume-job matching for 500+ neurodivergent candidates 
Designed, built system with Google Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Natural Language API, and Django to train model on 900+ files

**Mooch**
$1.5m pre-seed company building envelope-organized budgeting app providing cash back rewards on blockchain/DeFi
Designed, developed, and launched feature in settings end-to-end, including server and client side engineering 
Facilitated gatekeeper migration to improve A/B testing by enabling end-to-end observability for feature release control
