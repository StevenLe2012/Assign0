# Theodore Kanell README

## School:
I am currently a CS coterm. For undergraduate, I majored in CS on the Systems track, and for my masters I am doing the AI track.  

I am a CA for cs107 and also CAed the class last quarter. Before that I was a Section leader for several years. I really enjoy teaching and helping other students. 

## Projects:
Last quarter I worked on a research project that is curerntly be considered for publication. We used s series of LLMs to take a given topic and generate a Wikipedia style article. The article needed to be separted into different sections and not hallucinate. We were able to effectively eliminate hallucination and provide citations for claims, although it wasn't perfect. 

I, also, interned at Adobe the past two summers. The past summer I worked on a project to incorporate AI to group different messaging and tasks in a sort of zero-shot training. Before that I worked on building a pipeline monitor for database Monitor, meant to determine that all parts were working correctly and where bottlenecks existed.

I took CS194W with Jay two years ago and I really enjoyed the experience. I found it quite rewarding to work as part of a team and to take ownership of the project. My team built a web app that would monitor NFT markets and alert users when prices on specified NFTs reached set thresholds. I had a great team that I really enjoyed working with. I'm hoping for a similar experience in this class. 


## Skills:
I have experience working with and setting up databases. Experienced in C, C++, Javascript, Web development, and recently in using ChatGPT to help me build UI tools.
