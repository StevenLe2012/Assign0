# Theodore Kanell README

## School:
I am currently a CS coterm. For undergraduate, I majored in CS on the Systems track, and for my masters I am doing the AI track.  

I am a CA for cs107 and also CAed the class last quarter. Before that I was a Section leader for several years. I really enjoy teaching and helping other students. 

## Projects:
**Knowledge Curation**
Last quarter I worked on a research project that is curerntly be considered for publication. We used s series of LLMs to take a given topic and generate a Wikipedia style article. The article needed to be separted into different sections and not hallucinate. We were able to effectively eliminate hallucination and provide citations for claims, although it wasn't perfect. 

**Adobe**
I, also, interned at Adobe the past two summers. The past summer I worked on a project to incorporate AI to group different messaging and tasks in a sort of zero-shot training. Before that I worked on building a pipeline monitor for database Monitor, meant to determine that all parts were working correctly and where bottlenecks existed.

**GAN-BERT for Automated Essay Scoring**
Utilized a novel method in Automated Essay Scoring which in three iterations outperformed baseline.
Built three models which used competitive nature of GAN model to build discriminator that was able to accurately
score essays of TOEFL students.
Our third model utilized BERT model to generate additional essays capable of fooling our discriminator which
allows for the model to be trained with small datasets.

**Treehacks: Course Connections**
Developed project in Stanford Hackathon to ingest studentâ€™s transcript and determine similarity with other students
winning prize for best integration.
Utilized embedding model in neural network to predict students that would take future classes together.


## Skills:
I have experience working with and setting up databases. 
**Computer Languages:** SQL, CUDA, ISPC, Spark, C/C++, Java, Javascript, HTML+CSS, Python
**Libraries:** ReactJs, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Pyspark recently in using ChatGPT to help me build UI tools. 

**Fun Facts:** youngest of nine children and from a town with more cows than people.
