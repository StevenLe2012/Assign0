I am a senior studying computer science with an AI focus, a minor in ME and I am also coterming in ME. I am really excited
to hopefully get to take CS 210 this quarter and learn a ton. I am interested in AI, AVs, and robotics.

## Experience
- Undergraduate Research Assistant under Dorsa Sadigh in the Stanford Intelligent and Interactive Autonomous Systems Group (ILIAD). The project I am working on is
a research project with Toyota Reasearch Institute (TRI) to work on methods for using AI to improve how we can teach people how to drive and for improving how we
can train people to use semi-autonomous vehicles.
- Summer internship at Cruise last summer on the Compute and Networking Team.


## Projects
- For a final project, I worked on creating an agent that could play Backgammon with a set of heuristics and outperform a random agent. For this project, I had to access an
open source gym environment to have backgammon running on my computer. Then, I worked to come up with a set of game states and their associated reward values, assigning increasingly
positive rewards to better game states and increasingly negative rewards to worse game states. Next, I used a lookahead to calcualte the reward of all potential next moves,
and would take the move that had the highest reward. Through this implementation, the heuristic agent played against a randomized agent that was provided in the gym environment.
Over a large number of games, the agent was able to win a majority of games. This was a very cool intensive project, as understanding and modifyin gthe code base
for the Backgammon gym was a lot of work, but very rewarding to see the agent's success. This project was done in python.

- I created software that could take in a set of data and create a Bayesian network from the data and as well as score the resulting Bayesian network. My algorithm used the K2
algorithm to create Bayesian networks, and used the methodlogy for calculating a Bayesian Network from the course textbook: Algorithms for Decision Making. This was a
fun project to work on from scratch and had really cool and versatile applications. This project was done in python.

- I created software that could find a policy that maximizes the total expected reward for a Markov decision processes given sampled transitions, each consisting of a state,
action, reward, and next state. I used Q-Learning with a discount factor of 0.95 and a learning rate of 0.01. This project was done in Julia.
